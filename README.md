# RGB-Matrix-Stony-Brook-Commencement-Class-of-2022

* A fun project that I decided to do just for fun because I haven't decorated my graduation cap 
in my recent graduation years. Plus it's a great way to supplment what I've learned throughout my undergraduate 
career as a computer engineer and put it into good use by designing a cool application just for fun and make use
of it

* Good and interesting opportunity to put my project design into use to showcase my design during my once in
a lifetime undergraduate college commencement unless I go to graduate school in the future.

* Equipped my university graduation cap with a 32Ã—32 LED array, an Arduino Mega 2560, external battery source, lots of male/female wires, 
and lots of Arduino code. By doing this I was able to display interesting animations, pictures, and text on the LED grid. This 
repository contains all of the Arduino code, c code containing my bitmap images and some additional functions for good use.

# Supplies Used/To be Used for this COOL PROJECT!!!
  * Arduino MEGA 2560
  * 12V DC Power Jack Adapter Connector
  * DC 5V 4A Power Adapter (Switching Power Supply)
  * Adafruit Medium 32x32 RGB LED matrix panel
  * External Battery Source (USB Adapter or 5V battery)
  * Barrel Jack Adapter (5.5x2.1mm) to USB
