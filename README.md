# RGB-Matrix-Stony-Brook-Commencement-Class-of-2022

-> A fun project that I decided to committed to doing because I haven't actually attempted towards decorated my graduation cap 
in any of of my previous graduation years. Plus it's a great way to supplment what I've learned throughout my undergraduate 
career as a computer engineering and put it into use to designing a cool application just for fun and make good use
of it

-> Probably a good opportunity to put my project design into good use to showcase my design during my once in
a lifetime undergraduate college commencement unless I want to go to graduate school and be part of the graduate commencement.

-> Equipped my university graduation cap with a 32Ã—32 LED array, an Arduino Mega 2560, external battery source, lots of male/female wires, 
and lots of Arduino code. By doing this I was able to display interesting animations, pictures, and text on the LED grid. This 
repository contains all of the Arduino code and header c files containing my bitmap images and some additional functions for good use.

STATUS: IN PROGRESS
